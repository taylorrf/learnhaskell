title: Mapas e filtros

text: [fuction]map[/function] takes a function and a list and applies that function to every element in the list, producing a new list. Let's see what its type signature is and how it's defined.



The type signature says that it takes a function that takes an [code]a[/code] and returns a [code]b[/code], a list of [code]a[/code]'s and returns a list of [code]b[/code]'s. It's interesting that just by looking at a function's type signature, you can sometimes tell what it does. [code]map[/code] is one of those really versatile higher-order functions that can be used in millions of different ways. Here it is in action:



You've probably noticed that each of these could be achieved with a list comprehension. [code]map (+3) [1,5,3,1,6][/code] is the same as writing [code][x+3 | x &lt;- [1,5,3,1,6]][/code]. However, using [code]map[/code] is much more readable for cases where you only apply some function to the elements of a list, especially once you're dealing with maps of maps and then the whole thing with a lot of brackets can get a bit messy.

[fuction]filter[/fuction] is a function that takes a predicate (a predicate is a function that tells whether something is true or not, so in our case, a function that returns a boolean value) and a list and then returns the list of elements that satisfy the predicate. The type signature and implementation go like this:



Pretty simple stuff. If [code]p x[/code] evaluates to [code]True[/code], the element gets included in the new list. If it doesn't, it stays out. Some usage examples:



All of this could also be achived with list comprehensions by the use of predicates. There's no set rule for when to use [code]map[/code] and [code]filter[/code] versus using list comprehension, you just have to decide what's more readable depending on the code and the context. The [code]filter[/code] equivalent of applying several predicates in a list comprehension is either filtering something several times or joining the predicates with the logical [code]&amp;&amp;[/code] function.

Remember our quicksort function from the <a href="recursion">previous chapter</a>? We used list comprehensions to filter out the list elements that are smaller than (or equal to) and larger than the pivot. We can achieve the same functionality in a more readable way by using [code]filter[/code]:




Mapping and filtering is the bread and butter of every functional programmer's toolbox. Uh. It doesn't matter if you do it with the [code]map[/code] and [code]filter[/code] functions or list comprehensions. Recall how we solved the problem of finding right triangles with a certain circumference. With imperative programming, we would have solved it by nesting three loops and then testing if the current combination satisfies a right triangle and if it has the right perimeter. If that's the case, we would have printed it out to the screen or something. In functional programming, that pattern is achieved with mapping and filtering. You make a function that takes a value and produces some result. We map that function over a list of values and then we filter the resulting list out for the results that satisfy our search. Thanks to Haskell's laziness, even if you map something over a list several times and filter it several times, it will only pass over the list once.

Let's <em>find the largest number under 100.000 that's divisible by 3829</em>. To do that, we'll just filter a set of possibilities in which we know the solution lies. 




We first make a list of all numbers lower than 100.000, descending. Then we filter it by our predicate and because the numbers are sorted in a descending manner, the largest number that satisfies our predicate is the first element of the filtered list. We didn't even need to use a finite list for our starting set. That's laziness in action again. Because we only end up using the head of the filtered list, it doesn't matter if the filtered list is finite or infinite. The evaluation stops when the first adequate solution is found.

Next up, we're going to <em>find the sum of all odd squares that are smaller than 10.000</em>. But first, because we'll be using it in our solution, we're going to introduce the [function]takeWhile[/function] function. It takes a predicate and a list and then goes from the beginning of the list and returns its elements while the predicate holds true. Once an element is found for which the predicate doesn't hold, it stops. If we wanted to get the first word of the string [code]"elephants know how to party"[/code], we could do [code]takeWhile (/=' ') "elephants know how to party"[/code] and it would return [code]"elephants"[/code]. Okay. The sum of all odd squares that are smaller than 10.000. First, we'll begin by mapping the [code](^2)[/code] function to the infinite list [code][1..][/code]. Then we filter them so we only get the odd ones. And then, we'll take elements from that list while they are smaller than 10.000. Finally, we'll get the sum of that list. We don't even have to define a function for that, we can do it in one line in GHCI:




Awesome! We start with some initial data (the infinite list of all natural numbers) and then we map over it, filter it and cut it until it suits our needs and then we just sum it up. We could have also written this using list comprehensions:



It's a matter of taste as to which one you find prettier. Again, Haskell's property of laziness is what makes this possible. We can map over and filter an infinite list, because it won't actually map and filter it right away, it'll delay those actions. Only when we force Haskell to show us the sum does the [code]sum[/code] function say to the [code]takeWhile[/code] that it needs those numbers. [code]takeWhile[/code] forces the filtering and mapping to occur, but only until a number greater than or equal to 10.000 is encountered. 

For our next problem, we'll be dealing with Collatz sequences. We take a number. If that number is even, we divide it by two. If it's odd, we multiply it by 3 and then add 1 to that. We take the resulting number and apply the same thing to it, which produces a new number and so on. In essence, we get a chain of numbers. It is thought that for all starting numbers, the chains finish at the number 1. So if we take the starting number 13, we get this sequence: <i>13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1</i>. 13*3 + 1 equals 40. 40 divided by 2 is 20, etc. We see that the chain has 10 terms.

Now what we want to know is this: <em>for all starting numbers between 1 and 100, how many chains have a length greater than 15?</em> First off, we'll write a function that produces a chain:



Because the chains end at 1, that's the edge case. This is a pretty standard recursive function.




Yay! It seems to be working correctly. And now, the function that tells us the answer to our question:




We map the [code]chain[/code] function to [code][1..100][/code] to get a list of chains, which are themselves represented as lists. Then, we filter them by a predicate that just checks whether a list's length is longer than 15. Once we've done the filtering, we see how many chains are left in the resulting list.

<em>Note:</em> This function has a type of [code]numLongChains :: Int[/code] because [code]length[/code] returns an [code]Int[/code] instead of a [code]Num a[/code] for historical reasons. If we wanted to return a more general [code]Num a[/code], we could have used [code]fromIntegral[/code] on the resulting length.
