title: Pensando recursivamente

text: We did quite a bit of recursion so far and as you've probably noticed, there's a pattern here. Usually you define an edge case and then you define a function that does something between some element and the function applied to the rest. It doesn't matter if it's a list, a tree or any other data structure. A sum is the first element of a list plus the sum of the rest of the list. A product of a list is the first element of the list times the product of the rest of the list. The length of a list is one plus the length of the tail of the list. Ekcetera, ekcetera ...

Of course, these also have edge cases. Usually the edge case is some scenario where a recursive application doesn't make sense. When dealing with lists, the edge case is most often the empty list. If you're dealing with trees, the edge case is usually a node that doesn't have any children.

It's similar when you're dealing with numbers recursively. Usually it has to do with some number and the function applied to that number modified. We did the factorial function earlier and it's the product of a number and the factorial of that number minus one. Such a recursive application doesn't make sense with zero, because factorials are defined only for non-negative integers. Often the edge case value turns out to be an identity. The identity for multiplication is 1 because if you multiply something by 1, you get that something back. Also when doing sums of lists, we define the sum of an empty list as 0 and 0 is the identity for addition. In quicksort, the edge case is the empty list and the identity is also the empty list, because if you add an empty list to a list, you just get the original list back.

So when trying to think of a recursive way to solve a problem, try to think of when a recursive solution doesn't apply and see if you can use that as an edge case, think about identities and think about whether you'll break apart the parameters of the function (for instance, lists are usually broken into a head and a tail via pattern matching) and on which part you'll use the recursive call.
